# VBA_Challenge
For this weeks challenge I had to admittedly use various resources that were provided in order to finish.
My first course of action was to go over the weeks activities in order to decipher code placement, methods, and functions in order to come up with a plan to find the solution.
I then booked a tutor session and was given more insight into how I could go about naming specific variables in order to implement my headers for the worksheets.
I was unclear on what methods I was going to use to calculate the yearly change, percentage change, and stock volume when Mr. Perez my tutor gave me a different perspective on how to get the solutions.
After re-working a few activities I went to slack to see if any of my classmates were having similiar issues and came upon a discussion that highlighted what code was needed to loop through each worksheet
My biggest help was using slack to share a video call with my classmate Samuel Crain and taking advantage of his experience with VBA for Excel.
Mr. Crain showed me a number of different ways to attack the problem such as using Xlookup functions and other Screen update functions so that the code overall could run alot more smoothly while also giving me a deeper understanding of how everything worked.
We first created a script that could run on the alphebet_testing  worksheet so that we could make sure the code would run without any problems on the main challenge. 
He helped me create a script that looped through all the stocks for every year on the worksheets provided. 
I then added the functionality neccessary to isolate the specific stock that had the greatest % increases, decrease, and total volume for each year all at once.
